I am Student at BYU. I was formally a Chemical Engineering undergrad student, but half-way through I decided my post graduation plan was to go into aviation. However, I still wanted a college degree that I could use as a plan B. I had 3 years to finish my ChemE degree, or I could switch to Applied Statistics and graduate in 1 year. So here I am, a stat major who prefers engineering. So once I get my legs under me, I'll probably post a lot about the overlap between stats/CS and engineering.
