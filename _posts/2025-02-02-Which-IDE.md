## Introduction

During my long stay at university, I have tried nearly every mainstream Python IDE. It seems like every professor has their preference, and if I ventured out on my own with an IDE they didn’t like, then I was on my own when I needed tech support.

This, in turn, means that I have used a ridiculous amount of software programs that essentially do the same thing. I probably have eight different online textbook accounts because each respective teacher put down their roots in a different platform. The same goes for Python. I have been required to use Python on various IDEs, leading me to have three or four IDEs on my computer at any given point.

So, instead of moaning about it, I might as well put my experience to use. Hence, this post.


## PyCharm

PyCharm’s free Community edition is a great choice for general Python programming. However, PyCharm can be resource-intensive, leading to slower performance on less powerful machines. Additionally, its steep learning curve may be overwhelming for beginners who are just starting with Python. It is a little hard for me to judge, actually, because this was the first IDE I used, but I thought setup and UI were pretty intuitive. In my mind, PyCharm is like a Python-specific version of VS Code, and if you are only coding in Python, it is much easier to use than VS Code.


## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a widely used and highly customizable IDE that supports Python through extensions. One of its biggest advantages is its lightweight nature, making it a great option for users who want a fast and efficient coding environment. VS Code features an intuitive user interface, a built-in terminal, and support for Git, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced developers. The Python extension enhances its capabilities by providing linting, debugging, and Jupyter Notebook integration. However, since VS Code is a general-purpose editor, it may require additional configuration to match the seamless experience provided by dedicated Python IDEs like PyCharm.

**Pros:**
- Fast
- Customizable
- Very capable

**Cons:**
- Complex setup
- So many features that it can get confusing
**Pros:**
- Capable
- Simpler than VS Code

**Cons:**
- Slow
- Only works with Python
- More complex than Colab


## Anaconda (Spyder & Jupyter Notebook)

I first used this IDE in an engineering class. The focus of the class was to use coding to solve complex math/engineering equations. This meant we really only used basic coding functions, which Anaconda worked great for. While it was able to do more than just basic functions, it was a lightweight program and wouldn't be able to hold its own against the two programs mentioned above.

**Pros:**
- Lightweight
- Very intuitive
- Comes preloaded with packages

**Cons:**
- Long boot time


## Google Colab

Google Colab is a cloud-based Python environment that provides free access to Jupyter Notebooks with built-in GPU support. Colab allows users to write and execute Python code directly in their browser without any local installation, making it highly accessible for beginners and students. Shortly after starting the mentioned engineering class, I switched to Google Colab. It was great to have it cloud-based (Google Drive). I could log into any computer and start working. It was the easiest to use, fastest to “install,” and most dynamic between my various devices. However, it came at the cost of heavy-duty programming. It was much more geared towards lightweight programs and solving math equations.

**Pros:**
- Cloud-based, no installation required
- Easy to use and access from anywhere
- Great for quick scripts and math-based tasks

**Cons:**
- Limited in terms of heavy-duty programming
- Requires an internet connection
- Session time limits and automatic resets


## Conclusion

Ultimately, VS Code is my go-to IDE. This is because it is powerful and a one-stop shop. It does everything I need an IDE to do and does it fairly well. I don’t really see a reason I’ll ever go to PyCharm, but that’s because I use multiple languages between my classes.

My second choice is Google Colab. I love Google Colab, and if it offered a few more options, it would be my go-to IDE. It is so simple and works well. I would 10/10 recommend this IDE for anyone learning to code or who needs a lightweight IDE. I also can’t really see why I would use Anaconda Notebook because I can do everything in Anaconda on Colab, and Colab does it better.
